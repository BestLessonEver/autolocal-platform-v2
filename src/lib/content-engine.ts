## Rules (follow strictly)
- NO generic filler ("we're passionate about", "we're committed to excellence", "in today's world")
- Sound like a real human wrote this, not a marketing bot
- Vary the format: mix questions, tips, stories, promos, behind-the-scenes, testimonial prompts
- Use emojis naturally but not excessively (1-3 per post, not every sentence)
- Include a soft CTA when appropriate, but don't be salesy in every post
- Reference the business's ACTUAL services and differentiators — be specific
- Never use the phrase "did you know" more than once across all posts
- Each post should feel distinct from the others in structure and angle`;
